					<h2>Where Young Men are Outfitted for a Godly Life</h2>
					<p>YMO was created to guide boys on their paths to become godly young men and to let them see devout men in action. As a member of YMO, each boy is assigned a guide who will spend time with him, teach him God's word, guide him and model for him the characteristics of a godly man. The boys will benefit from outdoor activities such as hunting, fishing, boating, ATV riding and more. We call our mentors guides because that is their purpose - to guide. They are here to lead the way and to assist moms and other caretakers as they help boys become godly men.</p>

						<p>What God the Father considers to be pure and genuine religion is the: to take care of orphans and widows in their suffering and to keep oneself from being corrupted by the world. - James 1:27</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>See that justice is done - help those who are oppressed, give orphans their rights, and defend widows. - Isaiah 1:17</p>

					<h2>Who does the ministry serve?</h2>
					<p>This ministry is built around scripture that calls for men to help woman and children in their distress. It is for boys of moms who are widowed, or who realize their sons need a strong male influence in their lives. YMO is focused on boys ages 7-13 who have no dads, or whose dads are seldom involved in their lives (less than one time per month.)</p>

					<h2>YMO Guides</h2>
					<p>Our are there to help the boys have fun and to grow into godly men. Guides focus their attention on the boys, listen to them and participate in the activities their boys enjoy most. We put an emphasis on outdoor activities such as water skiing, hunting, fishing, ATV riding, and other sports. We encourage moms to inform their boy's guides of his upcoming school assemblies, such as band, sports or acedemic extracurricular activites so the guide can attend the event. We all want to be applauded for our achievements, and for growing boys, praise is essential.</p>

					<p>Our goal is for the boys to enjoy building memories with their guides, and for them to realize their full potential and to realize the dreams that God has put in their hearts.</p>

					<p>Our guides want to build a foundation of hope and achievement for these young men that will support them all their lives.</p>

					<h2>How often to the boys see their guides?</h2>
					<p>Our guides are committed to serve the ministry two hours a week, with one session a month devoted to Bible study, and one session every two months devoted to a service project.</p>

					<h3>YMO Founder and Leader</h3>
					<p><img src="img/cadamson.jpg" class="headshot" alt="">
					After coaching youth sports and being involved in mentoring young men for 35 years, I realised one of my greatest joys is investing in the future of fatherless boys and watching them grow through Christ. Young men are crying out for attention. They deserve the opportunity to do outdoor activities and they need a man to guide them in their journey to become a godly man.</p>
					<p>YMO guides and I can help them on that jouney. My hope is that my boys get as much enjoyment out of YMO as our guides do, and that we are able to build a foundation of hope and achievement for these young men that will support them all their lives.</p>
